## Investigations

This is a repository of documentation of investigations that I make into various Cybersecurity "incidents" and/or artifacts that I find myself coming across.

My main intention is to analyze and investigate phishing and spam that I am a target of and document my process and/or findings without doxxing myself too much in the process.
