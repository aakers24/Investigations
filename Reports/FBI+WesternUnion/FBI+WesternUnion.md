## FBI Director Sends an Email Regarding Western Union

Date Recieved: 9-3-23

Notes:

* I recieved an email that was sent to my spam folder at Sun, 03 Sep 2023 07:46:10 -0700 (PDT).

* The email claims to be from the director of the FBI regarding Western Union scams and claims I should be given $6.5 million. It wants me to send my information to `betsyholden940@gmail.com`.

* Obviously the email isn't real and is a scam, but some of the information in the headers is more convincing than the previous McAfee scam. They're spoofing a lot of information from the official Connecticut ct.gov and microsoft services.

* From a technical standpoint, the most immediate thing that's fishy is the sender's email address domain is `test.net`.

    * Some other indicators include that fact that the recipients were an oddly named list and the recipient is addressed as "Beneficiary" in the opening line "Attn: Beneficiary" which does not seem very professional for an official email from the director of the FBI. The wording of the email is also a bit idiosyncratic.

* I also found some records of other scam emails with the address `BetsyHolden<number>@gmail.com`.

* After a bunch of checking various information from the email and where those lead me, most of the results aren't inherently suspicious or malicious. I believe this indicates that this scam is new and thus the infrastructure's reputation hasn't had time to fall yet and/or a savvy threat actor is behind it. Furthermore, the primary "deliverable" was the email to respond to where victims will presumably send their information. Because of this, there isn't as much to track down and investigate. Probably the most significant thing I could do to get more information would be to email the address, but I won't be doing that at this time.
