Notes:

* At Sun, 3 Sep 2023 19:26:31 -0700 (PDT) I recieved an email in german from "T-Mobile" that seems to be about a Macbook Pro.

* *Something interesting to me- possibly just because I don't normally check- is that the delivery time was 15.5 hours. The ones I've seen are normally less than a minute.*

* The sender domain `berry[.]whirlibirds[.]com` has an untrusted reputation on Talos and the format of the site is very much akin to the websites found in the McAfee emails.

* The true sender also seems to have come from or at least gone through Russia.

* The email also follows the same format as the McAfee emails in that the whole thing is pretty much 1 link. Again, it's a googleapi resource that redirects to another resource/site.

* The link ends up at a Malaysian website `fenemoregroup[.]com` unsubscribe page which is presumably to get someone to input their email.
