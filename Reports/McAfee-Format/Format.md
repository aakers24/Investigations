## McAfee Format

This is a folder of emails that follows the same format. The emails all share the same formats with the main differences being the senders and the fake story associated with the email. The other artifacts such as domains that are left behind also all share formats and assets. These emails, the first of which I received from "McAfee," all share the same tactics and high-level outlines.

Rather than create new entries for each of these, I will use this entry to collect notable information on this format as a whole.

Notable information:

* `amdocument[.]com`

    * These "under construction" pages seem to all have an `/unsubscribe.php` seemingly to harvest an email

* `www[.]mostratic[.]com`

* `allworldcruise[.]com` - Many of the links in the emails go through a redirect to this site and then redirect to a final page.

* `raydesilva[.]com` - This is one of those that is in the sender's domain and puzzles me a little bit because some of these follow the same format and template and the only thing with the overt possibility of mal intent is the unsubscribe page which I'm assuming is to harvest emails. The thing I don't get is why there is website hosted there in the first place, especially since I'm finding these through the email headers which no one would ever see unless they're looking. My thoughts are that it's to make the domain look more legit, but if no one is ever going there then what's the point? I think it's clear that the websites are part of illegitimate activity and not real websites being used for legit purposes because they're all sending spam/scam/phishing emails and follow the same formats.

* `opt[.]listarmor[.]com`

* `orozco[.]newenglandmuscle[.]com`

* `lissiak[.]com`
